# Project: Caesar Cipher

This project implements the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and simplest encryption algorithms. It allows encoding and decoding of messages based on a fixed shift of letters defined by a key.

## Features

- **Encoding** text using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Decoding** text using the same algorithm.
- **Automatic removal** of whitespace from the input text.
- Support for **lowercase letters**.
- Simple graphical interface for user interaction.

## How the Caesar Cipher Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter of the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a key of `3`, the letter `a` becomes `d`, the letter `b` becomes `e`, and so on. In the decoding process, the shift is reversed to recover the original text.

Example of encoding with a key of `3`:

- Original text: `hello`
- Encoded text: `khoor`

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The primary language used to implement the cipher logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the graphical interface (if applicable).
- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation and handling events in the interface (if applicable).
